## Jeopardy - The Game
* Television quiz show where three contestants compete to answer quesions
* Their responses must be in the form of a question
* The daily syndicated version of the show has been on the air since 1984.

## Game Description
* The show has two rounds and a final.
* Each round has 6 categories each with 5 clues
* Clues have increasing dollar amounts within a category.

## Final Jeopardy
* Players are told the category
* They can wager as much of their score
* 30 seconds to write down answer
* Player with the highest score wins that amount in dollars
    * plays in the next day's game against two new players.

## Jeopardy Data
* Data scraped from Internet site
* Information about players
    * name, home city, occupation
    * number of correct and wrong answers
    * daily double play
    * number of games played, winnings

## Purpose of This Analysis

This document is an example of a data analysis
using Open Source R.

This is a reproducible analysis.
All code to recreate the analysis, from getting the data,
cleaning it, computing summaries, to creating graphics is included.
This means that the analysis can be rerun at a future time after more Jeopardy games have been played
and the results of those games are posted to the Internet.
The code for is available on Github at
[https://github.com/spkal/jeopardy](https://github.com/spkal/jeopardy).

As an example reproducible analysis, the code for the computations
are shown in the presentation.

## Use of TidyVerse

* This is also an exercise in using the `tidyverse` packages, especially:
    + the `dplyr` package, for data cleanup and manipulation
    + `dplyr::group_by` used for computing for each game
    + the `ggplot2` package is used for creating graphics.
* Extensive use of the new pipe operator (`%>%`)
that was introduced wtih the `dplyr` package.

## The TidyVerse

* A coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share a common data representation and API
* Rectangular data structures - `data.frame` or `tibble`
* First argument is typically the rectangular data structure
* Data is expected to be in a *tidy* format, one observation per row,
each variable is contained in a single column
    + The `tidyr` package can manipulate data into the tidy format
* Initial packages written by Hadley Wickham (hadleyverse)

## The `tidyverse` Package

* Installing the tidyverse package installs all the required packages
* Loading the tidyverse loads the most often used packages

```{r tidyverseimage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The TidyVerse", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tidyverse1.png")
```

## `dplyr`: A Grammar of Data Manipulation

* consistent tool for working with data frame like objects
    + both in memory and out of memory
* 6 basic verbs
    + select() - select columns
    + filter() - filter rows
    + arrange() - re-order or arrange rows
    + mutate() - create new columns
    + summarise() - summarise values
    + group_by() - allows for group operations in the “split-apply-combine” concept

## `magrittr`: A Forward-Pipe Operator for R

* TidyVerse API with common rectangular first argument allow using pipes (`%>%`)
* Avoids creating temporary variables that can clutter up the workspace
* Pipes are defined in the `magrittr` package
```{r magritteimage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is not a pipe", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("MagrittePipe.jpg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2, quietly= TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dplyr, quietly= TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

## The Data
* The data was scraped from the
[http://www.j-archive.com](http://www.j-archive.com) site
* Only regular Jeopardy games were downloaded,
leaving out championships, teen, college, etc tournaments.

```{r eval=FALSE}
jeopardyDataRaw <- jscrapeDirect()
```

## Scraped Data
The scraped data has 15 columns:
```{r}
names(jeopardyDataRaw)
```

## Cleaning the Data
* Variables were renamed to a consistent and descriptive naming scheme
* Cleaning operations:
    * values in the wrong column
    * spelling error in names of cities and states,
    * now living in ..." and "now stationed at ..." to listed location
* The cleaning was an iterative process
    * looking at summaries of the data
    * finding more errors,
    * making corrections

## Clean Function
* The clean up operations were all encapsulate in a single function `jcleanData`
* Run on the scraped data

```{r}
jeopardyData <- jcleanData(jeopardyDataRaw)
```

## Additional Variables
* `PlayerId` was created by pasting together the `Name`, `Occupation`, `City`, and `State`:
* Analysis of `PlayerId` indicated that it uniquely identified players
```{r}
jeopardyData$PlayerId <- with(jeopardyData,
  paste(Name, Occupation, City, State, sep='.'))
```
* `Date` variable was extracted from information in the `Title` variable
```{r}
airedIndex <- regexpr(" aired ", jeopardyData$Title)
jeopardyData$Date <- as.Date(
  substr(jeopardyData$Title, airedIndex+7, nchar(jeopardyData$Title)))
```

## Winning Amount
* After November 23, 2001 the game doubled the dollar amounts for each answer.
* A `GameMaxValue` variable was added to distinguish games before and after the change:

```{r}
jeopardyData$GameMaxValue <- ifelse(jeopardyData$Date <
  as.Date("2001-11-23"), "Max1000", "Max2000")
```

## The Winner
A variable, `IsWinner`, was added to identify the winner(s) in each game
(tied final scores result in multiple winners):

```{r}
isWinner <-
function (x) {
  r <- rank(x)
  if (all(r == 2)) {
    r <- c(4, 4, 4)
  }
  (r == 3) | (r == 2.5) | (r == 4)
}
jeopardyData <- group_by(jeopardyData, Show) %>%
  mutate(IsWinner = isWinner(FinalScore))
jeopardyData <- ungroup(jeopardyData)
```

## Gender
* Gender of each player estimated using the `gender` package from CRAN
* `gender::gender` function returns the proportion of males and females with a name
* A cutoff proportion of `0.75` used
    * if the proportion for a gender was at least `0.75`, use that gender.
    * if it was less than `0.75`, set to `NA`

## Gender Computation (non-Tidyverse)
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(gender)
firstName <- with(jeopardyData, gsub("^(.*?)\\s.*", "\\1", Name))
uFirstName <- unique(firstName)  # Only do the unique firstNames
uGenderDF <- gender(uFirstName)
uGender <- uGenderDF$gender
uFirstName <- uGenderDF$name
# Code "male" as "M", "female" as "F"
uGender <- ifelse(uGender == "male", "M", uGender)
uGender <- ifelse(uGender == "female", "F", uGender)
# Only consider gender that has prop. greater than propCutoff, else NA
propCutoff <- 0.75
uGender <- ifelse((!is.na(uGender) & uGender == "M" &
  uGenderDF$proportion_male < propCutoff), NA, uGender)
uGender <- ifelse((!is.na(uGender) & uGender == "F" &
  uGenderDF$proportion_female < propCutoff), NA, uGender)
mFirstName <- match(firstName, uFirstName)
jeopardyData$Gender <- uGender[mFirstName]
```

## Gender Computation
```{r gender}
library(gender)
jeopardyData <- jeopardyData %>%
  mutate(firstName = gsub("^(.*?)\\s.*", "\\1", Name))
# Only do the unique firstNames
uGenderDF <- gender(unique(jeopardyData[["firstName"]]))
# Only consider gender that has prop. greater than propCutoff, else NA
propCutoff <- 0.75
uGenderDF <- uGenderDF %>%
  mutate(Gender = case_when(
    proportion_male > propCutoff ~ "M",
    proportion_female > propCutoff ~ "F",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_))
jeopardyData <- jeopardyData %>%
  left_join(uGenderDF[, c("name", "Gender")],
  by=c("firstName" = "name")) %>%
  select(-firstName)
```

## Gender Results
* Gender predictions for
`r with(jeopardyData, sum(!duplicated(PlayerId) & !is.na(jeopardyData$Gender)))`
players
* `r round(with(jeopardyData, sum(!duplicated(PlayerId) & !is.na(jeopardyData$Gender)) / sum(!duplicated(PlayerId))) *100, 2)` percent of the players.

## Final DataSet
* The final dataset had `r ncol(jeopardyData)` variables:
```{r}
names(jeopardyData)
```
* Each row is data for a single player in a game as the basic observation
* Each games consists of 3 rows.
* `r nrow(jeopardyData)` rows and `r ncol(jeopardyData)` columns
* `r nrow(jeopardyData)` player observations and `r nrow(jeopardyData) / 3` games.
* There are `r length(unique(jeopardyData$PlayerId))` unique players.
* Games played from `r min(jeopardyData$Date)` to `r max(jeopardyData$Date)`

## Answers
* 6 categories x 5 clues per category x 2 rounds = 60 clues in each game.
* A single player answers are:
    * the sum of the number correct (`NumRight`)
    * the number wrong (`NumWrong`),
    * number of daily doubles correct (`DDRight`)
    * the number of daily doubles wrong (`DDWrong`)
```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(NumAttempted = NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) %>%
    with(summary(NumAttempted))
```

At least one player only attempted 2 clues and while another dominated
a game by trying 51.

## Number of Attempted Clues:
```{r plot01code}
plt01 <- jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(NumAttempted = NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=factor(NumAttempted))) +
        geom_bar() + xlab("Number Clues Attempted by a Player") +
        ggtitle("Distribution of Clues Attempted by a Player")
```
-----

```{r plot01, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
print(plt01)
```

## Attempted Clues by Gender

```{r plot02code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt02 <- jeopardyData %>%
  mutate(NumAttempted = NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(NumAttempted))) +
    geom_bar() + xlab("Number Clues Attempted by a Player") +
    facet_grid(Gender ~ .) +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Clues Attempted by Gender")
```

-----

```{r plot02, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt02)
```

Men tend to attempt more questions then women
and the range of values is wider for men including
some that attempt over 50 of the possible questions.

## Percent of Correct Answers
```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  mutate(PercentCorrect =
    (NumRight+DDRight) / (NumRight+NumWrong+DDWrong+DDRight)*100) %>%
  with(summary(PercentCorrect))
```

## Density Plot of Percent Correct Answers
```{r plot03code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt03 <- jeopardyData %>%
  mutate(PercentCorrect =
    (NumRight + DDRight) /
    (NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) * 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=PercentCorrect)) +
    geom_density() +
    ggtitle("Percent Correct Answers")
```

---

```{r plot03, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt03)
```

The most common percent correct values are between 82 and 90,
then it drops off but rises again at 100 percent.

## Always Right

The distribution of attempted clues for those who always
answer correctly compared to other players.

##

```{r plot04code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt04 <- jeopardyData %>%
  mutate(NumAttempted = NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight,
    PercentCorrect = (NumRight + DDRight) /
      (NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) * 100,
    AlwaysRight = (PercentCorrect > 99)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NumAttempted, color=AlwaysRight)) +
    geom_density() +
    xlab("Number of Clues Attempted") +
    ggtitle("Number Attempted for Perfect Player vs Other Players")
```

---

```{r plot04, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt04)
```

Most players who get all questions correct tend not to attempt as many questions as other players.

## Percent Correct Answers by Gender
```{r plot05code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt05 <- jeopardyData %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
  mutate(PercentCorrect =
    (NumRight + DDRight) /
    (NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) * 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=PercentCorrect, color=Gender)) +
    geom_density() +
    ggtitle("Density of Percent Correct by Gender")
```

---

```{r plot05, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt05)
```
We have the spike at 100 percent for both female and male players.
The female players have a more spread out distribution of percent correct
and their peak is slightly less than the peak for the male players.

## Daily Doubles
There are 3 daily doubles in each game, one in the Jeopardy Round and
two in the Double Jeopardy round.
The player who gets the daily double questions
can wager as much of their current score on the question.

The number of daily doubles found by players in a game:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  mutate(DDCount = DDWrong + DDRight) %>%
  with(cbind(NumDD = 0:3, DDCount = table(DDCount),
    Percent =  round(table(DDCount) /  sum(table(DDCount)) * 100, 2)))
```

## Percent of All Daily Doubles Answered Correctly
```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  filter(DDWrong + DDRight > 0) %>%
  summarise(PercentDDRight = round(sum(DDRight)/sum(DDWrong+DDRight)*100, 2))
```

## Number of Final Jeopardy Players

If a player has a score of 0 or less at the end of the double jeopardy round,
that player is eliminated from the final jeopardy round.
The number of players in Final Jeopardy:

```{r}
NFinal <- jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  mutate(NumberInFinal = sum(SecondRoundScore > 0)) %>%
  summarise(NumberInFinal = first(NumberInFinal)) %>%
  with(table(NumberInFinal))
cbind(NumberOfPlayers=1:3, Count = NFinal,
  Percentage = round(NFinal / sum(NFinal) * 100, 2))
```

## Only One Player for Final Jeopardy
Shows with only one player left for Final Jeopardy:
```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  mutate(NumberInFinal = sum(SecondRoundScore > 0)) %>%
  filter(NumberInFinal == 1) %>%
  select(Date, Name, SecondRoundScore) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

## Runaways
A runaway game is when one player cannot be beat in Final Jeopardy.

```{r}
isRunaway <- function(score) {
  score <- sort(score)
  all(score[3] >= 2*score[-3])
}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  summarise(Runaway = isRunaway(SecondRoundScore)) %>%
  with(c(NumberRunaways=sum(Runaway),
    PercentRunaways=round(sum(Runaway) / length(Runaway) * 100, 2)))
```

## Ties
How often does the game end with multiple winners (i.e. a tie)?

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  mutate(NumWinners = sum(IsWinner)) %>%
  summarise(NumWinners = first(NumWinners)) %>%
  with(cbind(Winners = 1:3, Count = table(NumWinners),
    Percent = round(table(NumWinners) / sum(NumWinners) * 100, 2)))
```

Most games have only one winner.
In three games, all three people had the same final score.

## Comebacks

How often does the player with the lowest score
at the end of the double jeopardy round, win the game?

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  mutate(IsComeback = (SecondRoundScore == min(SecondRoundScore))) %>%
  filter(IsWinner) %>%
  with(c(Count = sum(IsComeback),
    Percent = round(sum(IsComeback) / length(IsComeback) * 100, 2)))
```

## Final Jeopardy Stumpers

How often do all the players miss the Final Jeopardy questions?

```{r}
isStumper <- function(score2, score3) {
  all(score3 < score2)
}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  filter(all(SecondRoundScore != FinalScore)) %>%
  summarise(IsStumper = isStumper(SecondRoundScore, FinalScore)) %>%
  with(c(Count = sum(IsStumper), Games = length(IsStumper),
    Percent = round(sum(IsStumper) / length(IsStumper) * 100, 2)))
```

## Dollar Winnings in a Game

When looking at the dollar winnings for a game we look separately
at games before the dollar values doubled and after.

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  filter(IsWinner) %>%
  group_by(GameMaxValue) %>%
  summarize(AveWinnings=mean(FinalScore),
    MedianWinnings=median(FinalScore),
    MinWinnings=min(FinalScore),
    MaxWinnings=max(FinalScore)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

The mean and median winnings are both about doubled
when the dollar amounts doubled.

## Zero Winning Score

The shows where the winning score was 0:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  filter(IsWinner, FinalScore == 0) %>%
  select(Date, Name, FinalScore) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

Actually, none of the players were considered winners
since none of these players played in the next day's game.

## Distribution of Winnings
```{r plot06code}
plt06 <- filter(jeopardyData, IsWinner) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=FinalScore)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000) +
    facet_grid(GameMaxValue ~ .) +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Game Winnings")
```

---

```{r plot06, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt06)
```

There are
`r filter(jeopardyData, GameMaxValue == "Max2000") %>% nrow()`
with GameMaxValue of Max2000
compared to only
`r filter(jeopardyData, GameMaxValue == "Max1000") %>% nrow()`
for Max1000.
It is no surprising that the spread of the FinalScore values
is larger for the Max2000 group.

## The Players
The `NumTimesOnShow` variable increases each time the player is on the show.
We want to look at the maximum value of `NumTimeOnShow` for each player:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  mutate(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
  with(summary(MaxNumGames))
```

Half the players only are on one show.
Which is not surprising since two players (usually) do not return.
One player was on 75 times.
We will investigate that player later.

## Games by Gender

Number of games played by gender:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  mutate(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(Min=min(MaxNumGames), Median=median(MaxNumGames),
    Mean=mean(MaxNumGames), Max=max(MaxNumGames)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

## Most Wins

Looking at the players who won the most games (10 or more),
the Date is the date of their final game:

```{r, mostwinscode, eval=FALSE}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  summarise(Name = first(Name), MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow),
    Date = max(Date)) %>%
  filter(MaxNumGames >= 10) %>%
  select(Name, MaxNumGames, Date) %>%
  arrange(desc(MaxNumGames), desc(Date)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

---

```{r, mostwins, echo=FALSE}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  summarise(Name = first(Name), MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow),
    Date = max(Date)) %>%
  filter(MaxNumGames >= 10) %>%
  select(Name, MaxNumGames, Date) %>%
  arrange(desc(MaxNumGames), desc(Date)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

##

The distribution of the number of games by a player,
leaving out the outliers (players who played more than 10 games)
as well as players who never won (i.e. only played one game):

```{r plot07code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt07 <- jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  summarise(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
  filter(MaxNumGames > 1 & MaxNumGames < 11) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(MaxNumGames))) +
    # geom_bar(binwidth=0.10, stat="count") + xlab("NumGamesPlayed") +
    geom_bar() + xlab("NumGamesPlayed") +
    coord_flip() +
    ggtitle("Counts of Number of Games Played by a Player")
```

---

```{r plot07, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt07)
```

Most winners only win once and winning more than 5 games is rare.

## Total Winnings Per Player
Here we look at the total winnings for player over all the
games she or he played.
The number of wins is one less than the number of times on the show.

Here are the winnings for the players who won 10 or more games:

```{r, totalwinningscode, eval=FALSE}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  summarise(Name = first(Name), MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow),
    Date = max(Date), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
  filter(MaxNumGames >= 10) %>%
  select(Name, MaxNumGames, Date, Dollars) %>%
  arrange(desc(MaxNumGames), desc(Date)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

---

```{r, totalwinnings, echo=FALSE}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  summarise(Name = first(Name), MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow),
    Date = max(Date), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
  filter(MaxNumGames >= 10) %>%
  select(Name, MaxNumGames, Date, Dollars) %>%
  arrange(desc(MaxNumGames), desc(Date)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

## Total Winnings
The total winninges versus number of games played for players who won less than 10 games
(we use jitter to better visualize the data in each group):

```{r plot08code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt08 <- group_by(jeopardyData, PlayerId) %>%
  mutate(NumberWins = n() - 1) %>%
  summarise(Wins = first(NumberWins), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
  filter(Wins > 0) %>%
  filter(Wins < 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Wins, y=Dollars)) +
    geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = .3)) +
    ggtitle("Total Amount Won by a Player versus Number of Games Played")
```

---

```{r plot08, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt08)
```

## Another Look at Winnings

```{r plot09code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt09 <- jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  mutate(NumberWins = n() - 1) %>%
  summarise(Wins = first(NumberWins), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
  filter(Wins > 0) %>%
  filter(Wins < 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Wins, y=Dollars)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(group = Wins)) +
    ggtitle("Amount Won by a Player versus Number of Games Played")
```

---

```{r plot09, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt09)
```

## Gender

The gender of the
`r length(unique(jeopardyData$PlayerId))`
players:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  summarise(Gender1 = first(Gender)) %>%
  with(cbind(Count=table(Gender1),
    Percent=round(table(Gender1)/sum(table(Gender1)) * 100, 2)))
```

This is the gender of all the players
(that we were able to compute the gender for)
and is close to 50:50.
At least one third of all of these players will play in more than one game
(see earlier analysis of number of names played by gender).

## Gender Triads

* There are 4 possible combinations for the 3 contestants:
FFF, FFM, FMM, and MMM.
* Since the winner plays in the next game,
the same player can contribute to many gender triads.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trigen <- function(gen) {
  if(any(is.na(gen))) {
    NA_character_
  } else {
    paste0(sort(gen), collapse = "")
  }
}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  summarise(ShowGender = trigen(Gender)) %>%
  with(cbind(Count=table(ShowGender),
    Percent=round(table(ShowGender)/sum(table(ShowGender)) * 100, 2))) %>%
  knitr::kable(padding=0)
```

## Triads

```{r, echo=FALSE}
trigen <- function(gen) {
  if(any(is.na(gen))) {
    NA_character_
  } else {
    paste0(sort(gen), collapse = "")
  }
}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  summarise(ShowGender = trigen(Gender)) %>%
  with(cbind(Count=table(ShowGender),
    Percent=round(table(ShowGender)/sum(table(ShowGender)) * 100, 2))) %>%
  knitr::kable(padding=0)
```

A lot more games are played with two or more male contestants.

## Ken Jennings

The player with longest winning streak, 74 games
(the 75th game was a loss):

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(PlayerId) %>%
  mutate(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
  filter(MaxNumGames == 75) %>%
  summarise(NumberWins = n() - 1) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

Ken Jennings won
`r filter(jeopardyData,
    PlayerId == "Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah",
        NumTimesOnShow < 75) %>%
    summarise(TotalWinnings = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
	pull() %>%
    format(scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")`
dollars in his 75 games.

## Ken Jennnings Final Game

The final scores in the game he lost:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%

## Ken Jennings Winnings by Game

His winnings by game:

```{r plot10code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt10 <- filter(jeopardyData,
  PlayerId == "Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah",
    NumTimesOnShow < 75) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=FinalScore)) + geom_point() +
    xlab("Date in 2004") +
    ggtitle("Ken Jennings Winnings by Date of Game")
```

---

```{r plot10, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt10)
```

## Ken Jennings Percent Correct

Jennings percent correct in each game:

```{r plot11code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
filter(jeopardyData,
  PlayerId == "Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah") %>%
  mutate(PercentCorrect =
    (NumRight + DDRight) / (NumRight + NumWrong + DDWrong + DDRight) * 100) %>%
  with(summary(PercentCorrect))
```

## Ken Jennings Runaways

How often did Jennings win in a runaway?

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
  group_by(Show) %>%
  filter("Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah"
    %in% PlayerId, all(NumTimesOnShow < 75)) %>%
  summarise(Runaway = isRunaway(SecondRoundScore)) %>%
  with(c(NumberRunaways=sum(Runaway),
    PercentRunaways=round(sum(Runaway)/length(Runaway)*100, 2)))
```

## Players by State

* Where do Jeopardy players come from?
* While there are players from countries other than the United States,
the vast majority are from the U.S.

The number of players from each state;

```{r plot12code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
NPlayers <- table(jeopardyData$State)
stateDF <- data.frame(State = names(NPlayers),
  NPlayers = c(NPlayers)) %>%
  filter(State %in% c(state.name, "D.C."))
plt12 <- ggplot(stateDF, aes(x=NPlayers,
  y=ordered(State, levels=State[order(NPlayers)]))) +
  geom_point() + xlab("Number of Players") + ylab("State") +
  ggtitle("Number of Players by State")
```

---

```{r plot12, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt12)
```

The state with more people tend to have more players on Jeopardy.
To make more appropriate comparisons, we need state population data.

## State Population Data
State population data was downloaded from the U.S. Census
http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2012/tables/NST-EST2012-01.csv.
The CSV file includes aggregation data at the top and population values
for multiple years.
We only extracted the data for the 50 states and the District of Columbia
and only used the 2010 values.

```{r}
statePop <- read.csv("pop_by_state_2017.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
statePop[statePop$State == "District of Columbia", "State"] <- "D.C."
indx51 <- match(stateDF$State, statePop$State)
stateDF$Population <- statePop[indx51, "Population"]
```

## Players vs State Population

The number of players versus the state population:

```{r plot13code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt13 <- ggplot(data=stateDF, aes(x=Population, y=NPlayers)) +
  geom_point() + xlab("State Population") +
  geom_text(data=subset(stateDF,
      State %in% c("New York", "D.C.", "Texas", "Florida")),
    aes(Population, NPlayers, label=State, vjust=1.3, hjust=0.2)) +
    geom_text(data=subset(stateDF,
      State %in% c("California")),
    aes(Population, NPlayers, label=State, vjust=1.3, hjust=0.8)) +
    ggtitle("Number of Players versus State Population")
```

---

```{r plot13, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt13)
```

In general, the bigger the state's population, the more players from that state.
Texas and Florida have the second and fourth largest population but
a low number of players and D.C. with a small population,
has a disproportionate number of players.

## Normalized Players by State

To see if players are equally likely to come from any U.S. state,
we want to compare the number of players from each state
to the state's population.
We add a standardized number of players per million people in a state to the
`stateDF` dataset:

```{r}
stateDF$PlayersPerMillion <- with(stateDF, NPlayers/Population * 1e6)
```

The number of players standardized by state's population (on log2 scale):

```{r plot14code, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
plt14 <- ggplot(data=stateDF, aes(x=log2(PlayersPerMillion),
    y=ordered(State, levels=State[order(stateDF$PlayersPerMillion)]))) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Number of Players / 1 Million Population") + ylab("State") +
  ggtitle("Number of Players Standardized by State Population")
```

---

```{r plot14, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
print(plt14)
```

The East coast and West Coast is very well represented
after adjusting for population.
The Midwest is mostly in the middle and the South and plains states are
under represented.
