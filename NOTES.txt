Started paper.txt that contains notes on what to show in the paper.

Added Winner.p to jeopardyData that identifies the winner
of each game (code in winner.R)

Sourced in revised jcleanData.R that includes removal of WebID 504
that is an incomplete show (see mar-11-2013 note).

Applied jcleanData to jeopardyData to get new jeopardyData with no
WebID 504.

2001-11-26, Show 3966, WebID 1062, clue dollar values are doubled

Game 1290, WebID 504 has no DD and no final results, consider dropping?

Use stringr::str_trim to trim leading and trailing white space instead
of assuming a single space after commas.  Applied to City and State
in jscrapeDirect.R.  May want to apply str_trim in vector fashion
at the end.
